# Frameless resizable window with NiceGUI on windows

## Some info

### What is this ?
This project is just a quick work on the reimplementation of mouse resizability and movability for a NiceGUI frameless window on Windows.

### A small disclaimer :
This code is probably not very efficient and can be a bit ressource hungry. It's good enough for my needs but probably not for production.

### What can be improved :
~~Currently the east and south resize are still using the same function and therefore one of the two border snaps to the mouse.~~
There is also no resize function for the top and the left border but they are easily implementable with the code given.

I hope this small repo can help people stuck on this.
